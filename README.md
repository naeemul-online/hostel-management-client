This project aims to develop a Hostel Management system for a university,
enabling administrators to manage student meals and food reviews using the
MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Key features include
student login, meal management by admins, and the ability to edit or delete
food reviews and can manage their students.
Now, you will develop a fully functional Hostel Management system that allows
students to log in, view, and review meals, and enables administrators to
manage meal data and reviews efficiently. This system ensures streamlined
operations and enhances the student experience in the university hostel..
